Linked Lists are a linear data structure where the data is not stored in a container in the memory.
Basically, they can be anywhere. Preferrably in functions. 
Each element points to the next element, and the last element does not point to another element.

Nodes have data, and then the pointer for the next node.
First node is the head.
