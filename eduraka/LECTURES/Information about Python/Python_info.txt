Python was created in 1989 by Guido Van Rossum. Guido originally 
started developing the language as a hobby, and he wanted to create
a language which was easy-to-read for beginners. As an example,
instead of curly braces the language used indents.

The language was not popularized mainly because it was slow
compared to other languages
